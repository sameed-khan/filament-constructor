# Filament Constructor
MATLAB code for processing Imaris Filament statistics results to produce morphology metrics for 3D uterine gland volumes.

Instructions
1. Download the Github repository
2. Length metrics (path length, span, straight length, average branch length, tortuosity) and branch type classification can be generated using the script `manualFilamentsAllStats20x.m.` Code will need to be modified to appropriate filepaths for your local filesystem.
3. Reorient and prominence statistics can be generated using `thresholdFilamentsAllStats.m.` Code will need to be modified to appropriate filepaths for your local filesystem.
